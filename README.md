# intro-to-python
This repository contains version control for beginner python notebooks that can be grabbed from here or my google colab.
Each notebook contains learning material, and exercises.
When used in colab, these online notebooks don't require you to download or install anything. You just work in the notebook. They work on a desktop, laptop, or phone. It's the fastest way to start to learn coding.

The following are links to the colab notebooks. If you have a google account, you can easily make a copy in your own google drive to learn and do the exercises or play around with code.\
